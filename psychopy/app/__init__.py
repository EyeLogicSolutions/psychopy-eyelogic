    """Start the PsychoPy GUI.

    This function is idempotent, where additional calls after the app starts
    will have no effect unless `quitApp()` was previously called. After this
    function returns, you can get the handle to the created `PsychoPyApp`
    instance by calling :func:`getAppInstance` (returns `None` otherwise).

    Errors raised during initialization due to unhandled exceptions with respect
    to the GUI application are usually fatal. You can examine
    'last_app_load.log' inside the 'psychopy3' user directory (specified by
    preference 'userPrefsDir') to see the traceback. After startup, unhandled
    exceptions will appear in a special dialog box that shows the error
    traceback and provides some means to recover their work. Regular logging
    messages will appear in the log file or GUI. We use a separate error dialog
    here is delineate errors occurring in the user's experiment scripts and
    those of the application itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    showSplash : bool
        Show the splash screen on start.
    testMode : bool
        Must be `True` if creating an instance for unit testing.
    safeMode : bool
        Start PsychoPy in safe-mode. If `True`, the GUI application will launch
        with without loading plugins.
