# Touch Type Challenge

This demo tests touch typing ability by asking the participant to type out text being read to them at increasing speeds. If at any point they look more than 10% outside of the textbox, the routine ends, indicating that they failed that level. The further they can get without looking away, the better a touch typer they are.

The text in question is the beginning of The Odyssey by Homer, translated by Samuel Butler and read by Kirsten Ferreira courtesy of LibraVox. All LibraVox recordings are in the public domain, for more information visit www.libravox.org.
