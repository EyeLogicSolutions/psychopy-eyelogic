    """Class for recording audio from a microphone or input stream.

    Creating an instance of this class will open a stream using the specified
    device. Streams should remain open for the duration of your session. When a
    stream is opened, a buffer is allocated to store samples coming off it.
    Samples from the input stream will written to the buffer once
    :meth:`~Microphone.start()` is called.

    Parameters
    ----------
    device : int or `~psychopy.sound.AudioDevice`
        Audio capture device to use. You may specify the device either by index
        (`int`) or descriptor (`AudioDevice`).
    sampleRateHz : int
        Sampling rate for audio recording in Hertz (Hz). By default, 48kHz
        (``sampleRateHz=480000``) is used which is adequate for most consumer
        grade microphones (headsets and built-in).
    channels : int
        Number of channels to record samples to `1=Mono` and `2=Stereo`.
    bufferSecs : float
        Buffer size to pre-allocate for the specified number of seconds. The
        default is 2.0 seconds which is usually sufficient.

    Examples
    --------
    Capture 10 seconds of audio from the primary microphone::

        import psychopy.core as core
        import psychopy.sound.Microphone as Microphone

        mic = Microphone(bufferSecs=10.0)  # open the microphone
        mic.start()  # start recording
        core.wait(10.0)  # wait 10 seconds
        audioClip = mic.getAudioClip()  # get the audio data
        mic.stop()  # stop recording

        print(audioClip.duration)  # should be ~10 seconds
        audioClip.save('test.wav')  # save the recorded audio as a 'wav' file
