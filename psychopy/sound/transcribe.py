def transcribe(samples, sampleRate, engine='sphinx', language='en-US',

    """Convert speech in audio to text.

    This feature passes the audio clip samples to a text-to-speech engine which
    will attempt to transcribe any speech within. The efficacy of the
    transcription depends on the engine selected, recording hardware and audio
    quality, and quality of the language support. By default, Pocket Sphinx is
    used which provides decent transcription capabilities offline for English
    and a few other languages. For more robust transcription capabilities with a
    greater range of language support, online providers such as Google may be
    used.

    If the audio clip has multiple channels, they will be combined prior to
    being passed to the transcription service.

    Speech-to-text conversion blocks the main application thread when used on
    Python. Don't transcribe audio during time-sensitive parts of your
    experiment! This issue is known to the developers and will be fixed in a
    later release.

    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : ArrayLike
        Audio clip containing speech to transcribe (e.g., recorded from a
        microphone) as a Nx1 or Nx2 array.
    sampleRate : int or float
        Sample rate which `samples` was recorded in Hertz (Hz).
    engine : str
        Speech-to-text engine to use. Can be one of 'sphinx', 'google',
        'googleCloud', or 'bing'.
    language : str
        BCP-47 language code (eg., 'en-US'). Note that supported languages
        vary between transcription engines.
    expectedWords : list or tuple
        List of strings representing expected words or phrases. This will
        constrain the possible output words to the ones specified. Note not all
        engines support this feature (only Sphinx and Google Cloud do at this
        time). A warning will be logged if the engine selected does not support
        this feature. CMU PocketSphinx has an additional feature where the
        sensitivity can be specified for each expected word. You can indicate
        the sensitivity level to use by putting a ``:`` after each word in the
        list (see the Example below). Sensitivity levels range between 50 and
        100. A higher number results in the engine being more conservative,
        resulting in a higher likelihood of false rejections. The default
        sensitivity is 80% for words/phrases without one specified.
    key : str or None
        API key or credentials, format depends on the API in use. If `None`,
        the values will be obtained elsewhere (See Notes).
    config : dict or None
        Additional configuration options for the specified engine. These
        are specified using a dictionary (ex. `config={'pfilter': 1}` will
        enable the profanity filter when using the `'google'` engine).

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`~psychopy.sound.transcribe.TranscriptionResult`
        Transcription result.

    Notes
    -----
    * Online transcription services (eg., Google, Bing, etc.) provide robust
      and accurate speech recognition capabilities with broader language
      support than offline solutions. However, these services may require a
      paid subscription to use, reliable broadband internet connections, and
      may not respect the privacy of your participants as their responses
      are being sent to a third-party. Also consider that a track of audio
      data being sent over the network can be large, users on metered
      connections may incur additional costs to run your experiment.
    * Some errors may be emitted by the `SpeechRecognition` API, check that
      project's documentation if you encounter such an error for more
      information.
    * If `key` is not specified (i.e. is `None`) then PsychoPy will look for the
      API key at other locations. By default, PsychoPy will look for an
      environment variables starting with `PSYCHOPY_TRANSCR_KEY_` first. If
      there is no appropriate API key for the given `engine`, then the
      preference *General -> transcrKeyXXX* is used. Keys can be specified as a
      file path, if so, the key data will be loaded from the file. System
      administrators can specify keys this way to use them across a site
      installation without needing the user manage the keys directly.
    * Use `expectedWords` if provided by the API. This will greatly speed up
      recognition. CMU Pocket Sphinx gives the option for sensitivity levels per
      phrase. Higher levels

    Examples
    --------
    Use a voice command as a response to a task::

        # after doing  microphone recording
        resp = mic.getRecording()

        transcribeResults = transcribe(resp.samples, resp.sampleRateHz)
        if transcribeResults.success:  # successful transcription
            words = transcribeResults.words
            if 'hello' in words:
                print('You said hello.')

    Specifying expected words with sensitivity levels when using CMU Pocket
    Sphinx:

        # expected words 90% confidence on the first two, default for the rest
        expectedWords = ['right:90', 'left:90', 'up', 'down']

        transcribeResults = transcribe(
            resp.samples,
            resp.sampleRateHz,
            expectedWords=expectedWords)
